### **CS20A Data Structure with C++**
------------------------------------

This course is an introduction the computer algorithms and data structures. 
This course used the C++ language. The topics in this course includes concepts of c++, stacks,
queues, trees, sorting, searching, modeling, and dynamically managed space.

+ Project1 - Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

  This project is to organize the code according to the multiple file etiquette. 

+ Project2 - All of the Words

  This project will provide practice in using pointers, dynamic allocation, classes and multidimensional arrays.

+ Project3 - I'll link to like if linking liking move

  This project will have you implement a templated doubly linked list class, which has both a head and tail pointer, 
  and each node has a pointer to the previous and next nodes.

+ Project4 - Depth First Finding Nemo

  This project is implementing the stack and queue using a linked list, being able to understand and modify a significant existing code base,
  and implementing depth first search as outlined in Maze Searching Video(no backtracking).

+ Project5 - Binary Search Tree Function Implementations

  The goal of this prject is to understand Binary Search Tree function.
